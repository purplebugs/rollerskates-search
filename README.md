```bash
# Pre-condition: Downloaded .zip from Reference UI is in the root folder of repo

# Run this to set everything up
npm install

# Run this to start your application and open it up in a new browser window
npm start
```

## Deploy üöÄ

Published the app to any server as static assets and served with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

```
npm run build
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify deploy # enter ./build as the deploy path

Follow the command prompt to log into Netlify and deploy your site. This can be completed in just a few minutes.

## Usage üìö

### Updating configuration üõ†

The project can be configured via a JSON [config file](src/config/engine.json).

You can easily control things like...

- The Engine the UI runs against
- Which fields are displayed
- The filters that are used

If you would like to make configuration changes, there is no need to regenerate
this app from your App Search Dashboard!

You can simply open up the
[engine.json](src/config/engine.json) file, update the [options](#config),
and then restart this app.
